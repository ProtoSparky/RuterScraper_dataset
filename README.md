# RuterScraper_dataset
This is the dataset we gathered for RuterScraper

[The original project that got this dataset can be found at ProtoSparky/RuterScraper](https://github.com/ProtoSparky/RuterScraper)

The dataset is stored as a 7zip archive due to the fact that git could not calculate the deltas for almost 50k files (~300mb). The raw directory contains the raw data we gathered as JSON files, and the rest should be processed data stored in CSV format.
